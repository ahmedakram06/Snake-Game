# Snake-Game

The Snake game written in assembly language is a low-level implementation of the classic arcade-style game, demonstrating fine-grained control over hardware and memory. Unlike high-level languages, assembly requires the programmer to directly manage CPU instructions, screen rendering, and input handling, using BIOS or system interrupts. The game's logic involves controlling a moving "snake" which is denoted by a steric that avoids collisions with the red bricks. The points will be increased if the snake eats the green bricks.
